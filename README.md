# Handmade-Follow-Along
This repo is my personal progress of following the Handmade Hero Series on YouTube

You can learn more about Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero series at https://www.handmadehero.org/

The language used is C written in .cpp files to borrow some C++ features. I am following along using Vim, Cygwin, and Visual Studio 2017

Current Progress: Day 5

Side note: I've decided to supplement this follow-along with the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-C-Brain-Friendly-Guide/dp/1449399916" target="_blank"><u>Head First C</u></a>.
My current progress on this is: page 26
